        <p>
          King’s Coffee Co. was born in the heart of Mysuru, Karnataka, with a
          deep-rooted Passion for creating the ultimate filter coffee
          experience. Our journey began as a humble tribute to the rich heritage
          and culture of this royal city, Mysuru. Inspired by the legacy of the
          Mysuru kings, we set out to create a brand that would uphold the
          values of quality, tradition, and excellence that define Mysuru. Our
          customers are crowned kings at King’s Coffee Co., we ensure they
          receive nothing short of exceptional with every visit.
